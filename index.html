                        <p>Hi! My name is Kevin Hsieh (Shay). I'm a student with the University of Washington Full Stack
                            Bootcamp.
                            I stumbled upon this opportunity a few weeks after moving across the country from Maryland
                            to
                            Washington. Before being accepted into this program, I had zero coding experience. In fact,
                            in
                            undergrad, I studied to become a physical therapist.
                            </br>
                            </br>
                            Prior to moving across the country and beginning my journey in the world of tech, I was an
                            entrepreneur. My first business revolved around High-Performance tennis coaching. And I
                            loved
                            it. I got paid to play and teach the sport that I love. As someone who was born and raised
                            in
                            the tennis community in Maryland, it felt great to be able to give back to the community.
                            </br>
                            </br>
                            Outside of all that, my 2020 has been crazy, even without the move. As you can see in the
                            picture provided, beginning January, I was fortunate enough to travel to Asia (Indonesia and
                            Japan) and come back before Covid had spread.
